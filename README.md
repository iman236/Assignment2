1. We chose to use case 1

2 and 3. We think regression is the best way to predict the stock market price. And we'll use linear regression to do so. 
In linear regression there is always an input variable (x) and an output variable (y), just like we're supposed to
have(x = date and Y = price of the stock). It's also simple to use. Regression is used together with continuous data, just like we have 
in our datasat. Classification is used when the output will be a discrete variable (e.g. yes/no, type of animal, up/down etc.)
The ouput is a number, among an infinite amount of other numbers. Therefore it doesn't make sence to use classification.
